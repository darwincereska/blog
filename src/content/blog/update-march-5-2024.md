# Update on DCloud Services +  Other Durr Studios Products
Hey! Here are a few things that will be updated in the near future
### Whats new with DCloud?
I am thinking about making either a chat platform similar to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com), or [Discord](https://discord.com), but I am struggling between using [Astro JS](https://astro.build), or [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) as the front-end.
Another project I am thinking about making is a Google Docs alternative, with file sharing and such.

### What are my goals with DCloud?
My goals with DCloud or DCloud Services, are to test my knowledge of programming, and to make open source software of the big tech companies already great software. My goal isnt to replace but to have the freedom to change to my software.

### Other Updates
- In the next few months I am switching server hardware from my Dual-Core Levono Ideapad to either a Raspberry-Pi 5 or a newer Dell Optiplex, I am deciding to make this switch becuase the Ideapad has 2 gigabytes of ram and 20 gigs of storage.
- I am going to be doing a lot of work on the blog and my [Portfolio](https://durrstudios.dev), so I wont be active as much.
